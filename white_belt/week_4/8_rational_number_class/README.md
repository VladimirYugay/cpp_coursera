#### Implement class representing rational number ####

##### Requirements

* Default constructor creates a fraction with numerator = 0, denominator = 1
* With incoming parameters p and q, the fraction should be reduced
* If numerator is equal to 0, then denominator should be set to 1
* Implement operators + and - for Rational class
* Implement operators * and / for Rational class
* Implement >> and << operands
* Implement functionality to create maps and sets from Rational objects
